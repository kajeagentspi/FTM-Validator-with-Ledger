# FTM Validator with Ledger
Create a FTM Validator with a Ledger

Quick and dirty script that I made to setup a validator with a Ledger Nano X.

Use this script to securely create a Fantom Validator with a Ledger Nano X on a Windows machine.


### Instructions:
1. Unlock your ledger.

2. Change the following variables first.
```
VALIDATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS: Your wallet address

VALIDATOR_PUBKEY: Pubkey generated by ./opera validator new

VALIDATOR_STAKE: The amount of FTM you want to stake
```
3. Run the script. This should bruteforce what value you need to put to the LEDGER_WALLET_INDEX variable. If it finishes without printing "Wallet index: " you need to change the derivation path.

4. Comment out bruteforce() and uncomment main(). Should look like this

```
main()
// bruteForce()
```

5. Run the script again and confirm the transaction in your ledger. 

If it doesn't work or an error occurs please create an issue.
